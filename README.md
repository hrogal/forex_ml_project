# <u> Forex Predictions for Fun and Profit </u>
## Project Topic
The goal of this project is to predict if the foreign exchange rate (forex) for EURUSD will drop significantly during from its opening price during a single day. This is a supervised machine learning problem, specifically a binary classification problem. The main features used will be large stock economic indexes like the DOW Jones industrial average and the S&P500.

This project has the potential to inform the user on near-term currency exchange trends. If the price of EURUSD is predicted to go down in the next trading day, then the user can make a small profit by trading the pair near the opening price and again when the price changes. The details of this transaction will be discussed in the background section.

There are still learning objectives that can be achieved even if the predictive value of the models are low.
- Creating and testing the models helps to inform the casual day or swing trader if single features are useful as a basis for trading decisions.
- The process of gathering and processing exchange and index information can easily be extended to other currency pairs and market features.
